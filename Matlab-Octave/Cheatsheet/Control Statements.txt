Save a squareThisNumber.m file with these lines of code:
|function y = squareThisNumber(x)|
|y = x^2                         |
>> a = squareThisNumber(2)
  a = 4

You can also return multiple arguments at the same time:
| function [a,b] = multi(c) |
| a = c*c                   |
| b = c*c*c                 |
>> [x,y] = multi(5);
>> x
  x = 25;
>> y
  y = 125;

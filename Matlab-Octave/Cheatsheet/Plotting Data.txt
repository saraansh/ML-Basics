>> plot(x,y,'r') %plots the graph of (x,y) in red colour

>> hold on; %keeps the previous graph while plotting new one

>> xlabel('time') %Sets the label for x-axis
>> ylabel('y(t)') %Sets the label for Y-axis

>> legend('sin','cos') %Displays the legend for sin & cos

>> title('title') %Sets the title for the graph

>> print -dpng 'myplot.png' %Prints a png of the graph
>> % Might take a few seconds to complete

>> close %closes the graph

>> figure(1); %Plotting is done in the window 'Figure 1'

>> subplot(1,2,1); %Divides plot into 1x2 grid & access first
>> plot(x,y); %Plotted in the 1st half of the plotting window
>> axis([0.5 1 -1 1]) %Sets x and y axes limits respectively

>> clf; %Clears a figure

>> imagesc(A) %Plots matrix A using colours instead of values

>> imagesc(A), colorbar, colormap gray;
%Executes three functions together with a B&W color map,
a colourbar displaying the value each colour stands for.

>> linspace(a,b); %generates vector of 100 points between a & b
>> linspace(a,b,n); %generates vector of n points between a & b
>> logspace(a,b); %50 logarithmically spaced points between 10^a & 10^b
>> logspace(a,b,c); %logarithmically spaced c points between 10^a & 10^b
>> logspace(a,pi); %logarithmically spaced points between 10^a & pi

>> surf(x,y,z); %surface plot of x,y,z
>> surf(x,y,z,c); %surface plot of x,y,z with surface colour c
>> surf(z); %Surface plot of (row,column,z) as (x,y,z)
>> surf(ax,__); %axes are specified by ax
>> surf(__,'FaceAlpha',0.5) %semi-transparent surface property

>> contour(x,y,z,v) %Plot contour lines for z using (x,y) and v as LevelListMode property

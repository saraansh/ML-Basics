import pandas as pd

# Importing the train.csv from large_files directory
df = pd.read_csv("../large_files/train.csv")

# The file is exceptionally large for a github repository
# and can be downloaded from Kaggle via the link below:
# https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
# Kaggle is the famous hub for machine learning competitions
# and requires you to login before downloading the data file.
# The image is 28x28 pixels and thus df.shape returns (42000, 785)

M = df.as_matrix()

# The goal is to display all the images in the dataset.
# The rows represent the different images.
# Columns except column(0) defines the pixel colour.
# Storing the 1st Image
img = M[0,:1]

# Set the Shape of Image
img.shape # Gives (784,)
img = img.reshape(28,28) #Give the image the requisite shape

# Display the Image
plt.imshow(img)
plt.show()

# Display the image in grayscale
plt.imshow(img, cmap='Gray')
plt.show()

# To reverse the grayscale colors
plt.imshow(255-img, cmap='gray')
plt.show()

import numpy as np
a = np.array([[1,2],[3.4]])
b = np.array([1,2])

# A.x = B (Multiply Ainv on both sides)
# x = Ainv.B

# Solving x via equation
x = np.linalg.inv(A).dot(B)

# Solving x using in-built function
x = np.linalg.solve(A,b)

# solve() is both more efficient and accurate
# It is recommended never to use inv(A).

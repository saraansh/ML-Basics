import pandas as pd
t1 = pd.read_csv('table1.csv')

# Let table1 has the column names:
# user_id, name, email, age
# Let table2 has the column names:
# user_id, emp_id, work_hours

# Now to join, we use the common column name:

# Method 1
m = pd.merge(t1, t2, on='user_id')

# Method 2
m = t1.merge(t2, on='user_id')

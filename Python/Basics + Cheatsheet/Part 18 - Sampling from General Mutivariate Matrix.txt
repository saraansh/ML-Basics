# General Mutivariate Matrix
# Dimensions aren't necessarily independent from each other.
# This means we have a full covariance matrix.

cov = np.array([[1,0.8], [0.8,3]])

# Now we have a variance of 1 in the first dimension
# and a variance of 3 in the second dimension and
# the covariance between the two dimension is 0.8

# Importing Multivariate-Normal Module
from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal as mvn

# Drawing samples from a Multivariate Normal Distribution
mu = np.array([0,2])
r = mvn.rvs(mean=mu, cov=cov, size=1000)

# Plot Scatter-plot to verify
plt.scatter(r[:,0], r[:,1])
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()

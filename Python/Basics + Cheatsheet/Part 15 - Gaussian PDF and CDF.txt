# Normal Gaussian Distribution function
# with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
norm.pdf(0)

# Normal Gaussian Distribution Function
# with mean 5 and standard deviation 10
norm.pdf(0, loc=5, scale=10)

import numpy as np
r = np.random.randn(10)

# Calculating all pdf values at the same time
norm.pdf(r)

# Calculating logpdf is less costly and
# is preferred as a replacement for pdf
norm.logpdf(r)

# Calculation of cdf()
norm.cdf(r)

# Similarily calculation of logcdf()
norm.logcdf()
